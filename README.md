Flightbud is meant to be your mobile app companion for the air.

It uses the base Google Maps when run on Android, Bing maps when run on Windows, with airport and navaids information thanks to the Ourairports website:

Has integration to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The GPS location can be switched between using the GPS sensor on the device, or by detecting your location in the world from Microsoft Flight Sim 2020.

Thanks to Dragonlaird's SimConnectHelper, I have forked a copy of it into this repository.

The app is tested in Android, and is meant to also be run in desktop environment, and eventually in iOS.
